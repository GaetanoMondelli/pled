- By storing all the interactions between parts including timestamps, it is easy to establish who is right in case of conflicts 
- In some cases, by contract design the system can make possible only legit actions
- In some cases, the system can detects possible breaches and automatically notify the user
- Tell if an action would probably breach a contract using contract definitions or other cases
