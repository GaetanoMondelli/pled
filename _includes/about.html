            <div class="lead text-justify">Distributed ledgers technology (DLT) can track and replicate all the
                interactions and easily check whether or not they were compliant with the law or with the agreement
                terms.
                Today the most known application for DLTs are blockchains and smart contracts which can enforce

                Given a set of rules they can solve conflict or detect misbehaviours or check whether the parties are receiving the deserved benefits.
