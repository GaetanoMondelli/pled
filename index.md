    # Fall in ‚ù§Ô∏è with the problem, not with the solutions

    ### Let's make it clear: ***Pled is not a blockchain***

    Whether public or private, Blockchains are a form of DLTs that match specific requirements and constraints. In many use-cases, you don't need the complexity of blockchains to tackle trust and recordation related problems. Sometimes you should avoid it, especially when you want to guarantee the right combination of the following:

    - privacy
    - scalability
    - availability
    - non-repudiability
    - governance
    - regulatory & jurisdictional requirements
    
    Private blockchains are trying to fit the core technology into a more extensive and diverse class of problems. 
    
    Pled offers a user-centered platform, easy to onboard, to build transparent collaboration workflows at scale for **everyone**!
