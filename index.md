    # Fall in ‚ù§Ô∏è with the problem, not with the solutions

    Let's make it clear: Pled is not a blockchain.

    Blockchains, no matter whether public, private or permissioned-permissionless, are a speicific form of DLTs that have specific requirements and constraints. Blockchains are solutions to a class of problem that requires transparency, security and incentive mechanisms.  

    In many use cases today you don't need the complexitity of blockchains to tackle trust-related problems and sometimes you should not use it especially when you have 
    when you want to guarantee privacy, scalability, availability, regulatory and jurisdctional constraints. 
    
    Private blockchains are trying to fit the core blockchain technology into larger and diverse class of problems.
    
    You also don't want to be tied to an extremely volatile pricing model using public blockchains or locked in a complicated technology. 
    
    Pled started from scratch by designing a user centered foundational technology easy to audit and intepret for everyone!
